#  Healthcare Dataset Selection & Disease Risk Prediction

## Abstract
This project proposes an healthcare system that selects the most suitable clinical dataset using a Hesitant Fuzzy Rough Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (HFR-MADM) approach and predicts disease risk using machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- HFR-MADM

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Place datasets in the `data/` folder
4. Run the application  
   streamlit run app.py

## Output
- Best dataset selection
- Disease risk prediction
- Clinical performance metrics
